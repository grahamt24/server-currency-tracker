# What is Server Currency Tracker?
Tracks and records spending of gold during a session, shows amount spent, earned, loss or gain, and total gold on the server. I am planning on eventually having support for additional currencies to be displayed on upon chat command or minimap hover.

# Usage:
Type "/sct" or mouse over the minimap icon (gold stack) to display the information about your current gold on the server.

# Future Updates:
Additional support for other currencies to track and display them on minimap tooltip or in chatbox.

# Installation
To install go to https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/server-currency-tracker and follow steps there.
